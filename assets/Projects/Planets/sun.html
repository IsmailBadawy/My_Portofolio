                    data-text="It’s the nearest planet to the sun and is also the
                    smallest planet in the solar system and takes around 88 days
                    to complete one
                    revolution (to be exact 88.97 days) which
                    is the smallest time duration.
                    Its size is slightly larger than the size of the moon of earth. It does not have 
                    many moons and climatic conditions that are
                    not favorable for any form of life as
                    it is too near to the Sun. Its surface temperature ranges from 100 K at night to
                    700 K during the day (this high diurnal range of 
                    temperature is there because the
                    planet has no atmosphere to retain and this is the highest
                    among all planets).
                    It’s the second densest planet in our solar
                    system with the smallest tilt in its axis
                    among all the planets in the solar 
                    system."><a href="">Mercury</a>

                    data-text="When observed from the Earth, it’s the second brightest 
                    (after the observed moon) and takes 224.7
                    Earth days to complete one revolution and 243
                    Earth days for rotation on its axis (it takes the
                    maximum time period among all planets
                    to complete one rotation). It rotates in
                    the opposite direction to all planets except Uranus
                    (from West to East).
                    It’s also observed that one day on Venus
                    is equal to one year on Earth. It’s also called 
                    Earth’s twin sister because of its similar size, shape,
                    mass, and proximity to the sun and of its bulky 
                    composition. It’s not suitable for human settlement 
                    because it contains 96% carbon in the atmosphere. The
                    surface temperature is very high (a mean temperature 
                    of 735K), making it the warmest planet in our solar 
                    system."><a href="">venus</a>

                    complete one revolution around the Sun and 24 hours 
                    to complete one rotation on its axis (and after every

                    is divided into different tectonic plates (lithosphere). 
                    Earth’s innermost part remains active and its
